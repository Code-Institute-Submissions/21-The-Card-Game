# 21 The Card Game


# Project Summary

This website aims to demonstrate my skills of Javascript, HTML & CSS as learned from the Code Institute Full Stack Software Development course. In order to do so I will create my version of the card game Twenty-One. The project will be created using a mobile first design strategy and will ensure the site is fully responsive across all devices. The project will further the developers knowledge of Javascript and it's implementation.

# The origin of the card game Twenty-One

Twenty-One, formerly known as Vingt-Un in Britain, France and America, is the name given to a family of popular card games, the progenitor of which is recorded in Spain in the early 17th century. The game is first mentioned by name as early as 1611 in a Spanish dictionary where, under the entry for "card" (carta), it mentions the game of Ventiuno ("twenty-one")

Twenty-One rose to prominence in France in the 18th century and spread from there to Germany and Britain from whence it crossed to America. Known initially as Vingt-Un in all those countries, it developed into Pontoon in Britain after the First World War and Blackjack in Canada and the United States in the late 19th century, where the legalisation of gambling increased its popularity.

# Deployment

This website was created in the Gitpod development environment. After installing the Gitpod extension for Chrome web browser and creating a new repository in GitHub using the Code Institute template, the green Gitpod button was used to initialise the repository in Gitpod. Throughout the process the git commands `git add` and `git commit` were used to store the work in the local Gitpod environment, `git push` would then be used to push the commits to the GitHub repository. From here the website could then deployed to Git Pages:

## Git Hub Pages:

From the Git Hub repository:
 - Go to settings
 - Scroll down to Git Hub Pages section
 - Select branch to be deployed, in this case the master branch
 - Click Save

## Creating A Local Clone:
You can clone the repository to create a local copy on your computer.

From the Git Hub repository:
- Click `Code` at the top of the file list
- Click the clipboard icon to copy the url provided

Open terminal:
- Change the current working directory to where you want the cloned directory to be
- Type `git clone` and paste the copied url after it
- Press enter and the clone will be created
