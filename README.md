# Deployment

This website was created in the Gitpod development environment. After installing the Gitpod extension for Chrome web browser and creating a new repository in GitHub using the Code Institute template, the green Gitpod button was used to initialise the repository in Gitpod. Throughout the process the git commands `git add` and `git commit` were used to store the work in the local Gitpod environment, `git push` would then be used to push the commits to the GitHub repository. From here the website could then deployed to Git Pages:

## Git Hub Pages:

From the Git Hub repository:
 - Go to settings
 - Scroll down to Git Hub Pages section
 - Select branch to be deployed, in this case the master branch
 - Click Save

## Creating A Local Clone:
You can clone the repository to create a local copy on your computer.

From the Git Hub repository:
- Click `Code` at the top of the file list
- Click the clipboard icon to copy the url provided

Open terminal:
- Change the current working directory to where you want the cloned directory to be
- Type `git clone` and paste the copied url after it
- Press enter and the clone will be created
